# LessonJournalv 
This is part of a group project. I was responsible for creating a demo version of a simple lesson journal. Below are some screenshots of the application. The user interface is written in Polish.
It took me about two days to complete this project.

User can sign in as a teacher or a student. Then it is possible to change password see the list of grades or grade the student. Pictures were created in Canva.
